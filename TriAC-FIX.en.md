# Installing the KS-Fix on the Mainboard

If your refrigerator is running continuously and not receiving on/off signals from the module, then the TriAC is 
defective. This is noticeable if the back panel is iced up and the humidity reading on the dashboard remains constant 
for hours and is below the set target value.

## Overview

Unfortunately, there is a known manufacturing defect in modules prior to serial number 13115. In this case, a component 
is under-rated and will eventually fail.

### Details

The KS-Fix files, which can be found in the hardware section of the Plantalytix GitHub page, can be used for 
manufacturing, for example, at Aisler. However, it is more cost-effective to have them manufactured in larger quantities 
through the community.

Desoldering the defective TriAC works best with hot air. Soldering the TriAC-Fix board in place can be done with a 
standard soldering iron. Here are two screenshots showing a before-and-after view:
