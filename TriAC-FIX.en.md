# Installing the KS-Fix on the mainboard

If you have the problem that the refrigerator runs continuously and no longer accepts switch-on and switch-off signals 
from the module, then the TriAC is defective.

This is best recognized by the portal displaying that the refrigerator is switched off, although it is actually 
switched on.

## Overview

Unfortunately, there is a serial error in modules with serial numbers below 13115. In this error, a component is too 
weak and will eventually become defective.

### Details

The KS-Fix files can be produced via the hardware section on the Github Plantalytix page, e.g., at Aisler. However, it 
is cheaper to have them produced in larger quantities via the community admins.

The defective TirAC is best desoldered with hot air. The TriAC-Fix board can then be soldered in with a normal soldering 
iron. Here are two pictures:
