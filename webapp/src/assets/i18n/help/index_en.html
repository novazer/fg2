<h3>I can't find the wifi network of my controller!</h3>
<p>Please try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Ensure your controller has fully booted.</strong><br />
	The LEDs on your controller should show solid green or solid yellow. If they are still running in a circle, your controller is still booting. Be aware, that the boot process can take up to 10 minutes, especially if the controller was just updated.</li>
	<li><strong>Try to reboot your controller.</strong><br />
	Plug out the USB supple and wait for 10 seconds, then plug it back in. Once your controller has rebooted try to find the network again.</li>
	<li><strong>Try to reset your controller to factory defaults.</strong><br />
	Press and hold the button in the top of the controller's case until all LEDs have switched from blue to yellow. Wait until it has rebooted, then retry.</li>
</ol>

<h3>I'm connected to my controller's wifi network but it's not detected by the app!</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many smartphones popup the warning message "This network has no internet access". Ensure you have confirmed this message!</p>
<p><img alt="network has no internet" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7891a4ba-3f6f-49fe-a02b-8d33f0bdd4c1" src="img/wifinointernet.png" /></p>
<p>If you do not confirm this message, your smartphone won't fully connect to the wifi network and our app won't be able to work.<br />
Sometimes it takes a few seconds for this message to show up, so stay in your wifi settings page until it shows.</p>
<p>If that does not solve the problem, you can also try to activated airplane mode before you connect to the wifi network.</p>
<p><img alt="airplane mode" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b1032aa6-8d56-466b-b2e1-f1a7a6478790" src="img/airplanemode.png" /></p>
<p>Should you still be unable to detect our controller, please try a manual connection by checking "advanced" on the connection page and entering the IP address 10.20.30.1.</p>
